# USDC Ecosystem Catalog

The goal of this repository is to track the ecosystem of applications and businesses that support or
build on top of USDC.

To contribute to this catalog, please propose a PR with the following files by following the templates below:

1. An image of your app / company logo
2. A yaml file with the requested information about your app (one app per yaml file)

_By submitting your name and logo, you (i) represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind
your company or protocol; and (ii) hereby grant Circle permission to use your name and logo on its
website and in its marketing materials._

## Logo Constraints
Logos should conform to the following parameters:

- Acceptable File Types: .jpg, .png
- Image Size: 200 x 200 pixels
- Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (square)
- Max File Size: 5 MB

Note: Each app does not need its own logo. Logos may be reused by multiple apps under the same company / org.

## UUID Generation
For each app, please generate a UUID v4.

On Mac OS X:
```shell
uuidgen | awk '{print tolower($0)}'
```

On Linux:
```shell
uuidgen
```

You may also use an online tool to generate a UUID. (https://uuidonline.com/)
